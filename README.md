Hi! This is my consolidation project, where I've put together a full demo of a song idea I've had for a while called Brighter Days. There's a lot else I'd like to do with this tune with more time, particularly in terms of making the vocals sound better (retracking and mixing everything) and mixing/mastering, but here's where I was able to get in a week. I'm very proud of the instrumental and less proud of the vocal as of rn. I'm not in love with the chorus I came up with and I think I was torn with the lyrics in terms of it being a conscious song vs a personal thing, but here we are. Maybe I'll put a different version out for the public someday.

I've also added this to the audio page of my website portfolio.

Enjoy!
