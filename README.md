Hi! This is my consolidation project, where I'll be fleshing out a couple of song ideas in Ableton Live. One of them, Hey Lover, has a partial demo already in my website portfolio. I'll be doing a full demo of that song from scratch with vocals later this week. What I have for now is a preview of a song I've been meaning to demo for a while titled Brighter Days. I had a family commitment over the weekend, so this is what I was able to get done in about 6 hours between yesterday and today. I'm pretty well on my way to having a skeleton of the full track, as there is a fair amount of repetition of what I've already tracked here. Hope it makes you excited for what is to come!
